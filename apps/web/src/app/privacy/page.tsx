        service is intended for use &quot;AS IS&quot;.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

      <p>
        The Application processes limited information needed to provide real-time
        communication. Any data transmitted is used only to service your request
        in real time and is not retained by the Service Provider after the

      </ul>

      <p>
        The Application does not gather precise information about the location
        of your mobile device.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Provider does not use your information for marketing and
        does not retain session data beyond what is required to provide the
        service in real time.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service
        Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally
        identifiable information, including but not limited to Email. This
        information is used to identify you during a session and is not stored
        by the Service Provider beyond the duration of the session.
      </p>

      <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

      <p>
        The Service Provider does not share your personal information with
        third parties except to provide the service in real time. The Service
        Provider does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs to
        collect data from the Application.
