# @conclave/sfu

The Conclave media server: a [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org)-based SFU with
socket.io signaling, plus the HTTP admin control plane, scheduling/webinar
services, the server-authoritative game runtime, and transcript relays.

- **HTTP + socket API reference:** see [API.md](./API.md).
- **Game runtime (server-authoritative games):** see
  [server/games/README.md](./server/games/README.md).
- **Entry point:** `server.ts` (wraps `server/createSfuServer.ts`).
- **Deploy:** built via the included [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile); configuration
  comes from `.env` (see `config/config.ts` for every knob and default).

## Development

```sh
pnpm -C packages/sfu exec tsc --noEmit   # typecheck
pnpm -C packages/sfu test                # vitest unit tests
pnpm run lint:packages                   # workspace lint (from repo root)
```

Untrusted network input (express `req.body`, socket payloads) is narrowed
once at the boundary via [`utilities/untrusted.ts`](./utilities/untrusted.ts)
— never accessed as `any`. Game move payloads have their own throwing
decoders in `server/games/validation.ts`.
