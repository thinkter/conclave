/**
 * Server-side product analytics (PostHog) for the SFU.
 *
 * Design contract:
 *   - STRICTLY OPT-IN. With no `SFU_POSTHOG_KEY` set, `config.analytics.enabled`
 *     is false: NO client is ever constructed, and every exported function is a
 *     no-op. Zero network, zero allocation, zero overhead.
 *   - EXACTLY ONE client per process. The SFU is long-lived, so we construct a
 *     single batching `PostHog` client lazily on first use and reuse it. Events
 *     are buffered and flushed by `flushAt` / `flushInterval`, and on graceful
 *     shutdown via `shutdownAnalytics()`.
 *   - NEVER throws into the caller. Analytics is best-effort telemetry that must
 *     not break a socket handler; every public call is wrapped in try/catch.
 *
 * This module is transport-agnostic and generic: it knows nothing about games
 * specifically. The game handlers build event names + property bags and hand
 * them here. Group analytics (associating each event with the meeting/room) is
 * a first-class parameter so the whole game lifecycle for one room rolls up
 * under a single `room` group in PostHog.
