/**
 * Server-side backstop for issue #177 (a speaker audible to only a subset of
 * attendees).
 *
 * Audio consumers are created unpaused (see mediaHandlers `consume`), so in
 * the steady state a paused audio consumer can only mean one of two things:
 *  - the owning client explicitly asked for it via setConsumerPreferences
 *    (tracked with `clientPausedIntent` below), or
 *  - a `resumeConsumer` request was lost (rate limit, disconnect blip, an old
 *    client build) and the attendee is silently missing that speaker.
 *
 * The sweep resumes the second class. It runs cheaply over in-memory maps and
 * heals every connected client type (web, mobile, native) without requiring a
 * client update.
