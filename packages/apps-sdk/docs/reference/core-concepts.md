# Core Concepts

This page explains the conceptual model behind `@conclave/apps-sdk`: what an app is, where state lives, and how host/app/server responsibilities are split.

## What Is an App in Conclave

An app is a collaborative in-meeting surface with:

- stable app id (for example `whiteboard`, `polls`)
- at least one renderer (`web` and/or `native`)
- optional shared Yjs doc initializer (`createDoc`)

Apps are defined with `defineApp(...)` and registered with `registerApps(...)`.

## Collaborative Apps and Games

Conclave supports two in-meeting extension shapes:

- Collaborative apps use Yjs. Everyone converges on the same shared document. Use this for whiteboards, notes, polls, checklists, and tools where the shared state can be visible to all participants.
- Games use the server-authoritative game runtime. The SFU owns rules, timers, scoring, and private player views. Use this for hidden roles, trivia answers, timed reactions, scoring, and any rule set that clients should not be able to forge.
- Prompt-based games can opt into server-side generated content before the game starts. The host sends a normal config value such as a topic, and the SFU validates the generated object before it becomes game state.

If you are adding a game, start with [Add a Game to Conclave](../guides/add-a-game.md).

## Runtime Layers

Think of the system in four layers:

1. App definition layer:
   - `defineApp` shape validation
   - app metadata and renderer entrypoints
2. Host runtime layer:
   - app registry (`registerApp`, `registerApps`)
   - `AppsProvider` context for state + sync
3. App UI layer:
   - hooks (`useApps`, `useAppDoc`, `useAppPresence`, `useAppAssets`)
   - mutation/read logic with lock-aware behavior
4. SFU server layer:
   - socket handlers enforce permissions
   - relay Yjs and awareness updates by active `appId`

## Main Building Blocks

### 1. App Definition

`defineApp` validates app shape early:

- `id` required
- `name` required
- at least one renderer required (`web` or `native`)

### 2. Registry

`registerApp` / `registerApps` stores app definitions in a process-local map.

Key behaviors:

- repeated registration is safe
- registry updates are observable (`subscribeRegistry`)
- host process controls what apps are available

### 3. Runtime Provider

`AppsProvider` bridges the host socket and app hooks:

- owns one Yjs doc per app id
- owns one awareness instance per app id
- keeps shared room state in context (`activeAppId`, `locked`)
- exposes control operations (`openApp`, `closeApp`, `setLocked`, `refreshState`)

### 4. Shared Data Model (Yjs)

Each app can have one shared Yjs doc.

Use Yjs for:

- canonical collaborative data
- state that must survive reconnects
- state all participants should converge on

Use `createAppDoc` + helper initializers for deterministic schema setup.

### 5. Awareness / Presence

Awareness is for ephemeral participant state:

- cursor position
- transient selection
- temporary presence metadata

Do not store canonical app content in awareness.

### 6. Room App State

Global app state is room-scoped and shared:

- `activeAppId`
- `locked`

This state is exposed as `useApps().state`.

## Data Ownership Rules

- Durable shared content: Yjs doc.
- Ephemeral shared presence: awareness.
- Local-only UI state: React component state.

A useful rule: if it must be correct after reconnect, do not rely on awareness alone.

## Permission and Locking Model

- Admins can open/close/lock apps.
- Non-admins still receive state and sync traffic.
- When `locked = true`, non-admin Yjs content updates are dropped server-side.

Implication for app code:

- render read-only state when `locked && !isAdmin`
- keep presence updates visible even while read-only

## Typical Lifecycle Flow

1. Host registers apps.
2. Admin opens an app (`openApp(appId)`).
3. Server broadcasts `apps:state` with `activeAppId`.
4. Provider syncs active app doc via `apps:yjs:sync`.
5. App UI reads doc with `useAppDoc(appId)`.
6. App UI publishes awareness with `useAppPresence(appId)`.
7. App edits propagate through `apps:yjs:update`.
8. On lock, non-admin content edits are ignored by server.

## Host Responsibilities

- register correct app definitions for the platform
- mount `AppsProvider` with socket + identity + role context
- expose app controls only where appropriate (usually admin-only)
- visibly communicate lock/read-only mode

## App Responsibilities

- use a stable app id in all call sites
- design clean doc schema and separate awareness from durable data
- guard write paths for lock/read-only behavior
- avoid optimistic local writes when server will reject updates
