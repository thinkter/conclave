# Dev Playground Walkthrough

The `dev-playground` app is a development-only reference integration for SDK contributors.

It exists to answer one question quickly: "How do I build a real app on top of the Conclave Apps SDK?"

## Where It Lives

- SDK app files: `packages/apps-sdk/src/apps/dev-playground`
- Shared web app layout: `apps/web/src/app/components/MeetingAppLayout.tsx`
- Host registration: `apps/web/src/app/meets-client.tsx`
- Meeting controls wiring: `apps/web/src/app/components/ControlsBar.tsx`

## Why It Is Dev-Only

The app is registered only when `NODE_ENV === "development"` so production users do not see an unfinished sandbox in the apps menu.

## What To Learn From It

Use this app as a safe scratchpad for:

- wiring a new doc schema quickly
- trying awareness patterns before production rollout
- validating lock-aware UX behavior
- testing host controls without modifying whiteboard

## What It Demonstrates

1. `defineApp` with a stable `id` (`dev-playground`)
2. Empty-on-join Yjs document creation via `createAppDoc`
3. Shared primitives in one doc (`Map`, `Text`, `Array`)
4. Presence state with `useAppPresence`
5. App lock behavior using `locked` and `isAdmin`
6. Host-level app open/close toggles through `useApps`

## Data Model Example

The app stores this shape in Yjs:

- `counter: number`
- `notes: Y.Text`
- `items: Y.Array<string>`
- `meta: Y.Map` (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `updatedBy`)

Source: `packages/apps-sdk/src/apps/dev-playground/core/doc/index.ts`.

The factory intentionally leaves those keys absent. Read helpers expose `0`,
`""`, and `[]` without mutating Yjs; the first counter, note, or item edit
creates the corresponding shared type and metadata. This keeps reconnecting
clients from publishing defaults before their initial room sync.

## Run It

1. Start web host in dev: `pnpm -C apps/web dev`
2. Join a meeting as admin
3. Open `More options`
4. Select `Open dev playground`

## Suggested Debug Flow

1. Open app on one client and confirm `activeAppId`.
2. Join from a second client and verify sync convergence.
3. Toggle lock and verify non-admin read-only behavior.
4. Add presence metadata and verify awareness state updates.
5. Close and reopen app to validate lifecycle assumptions.

## Suggested Contributor Exercises

1. Add a second shared list (for example, "decisions")
2. Add cursor/selection awareness metadata
3. Add another lock-aware collaborative control

Use this app as a safe scratchpad before creating a production app integration.
